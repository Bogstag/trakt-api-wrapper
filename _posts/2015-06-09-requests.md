Each request that can be made to the Trakt API is an object that extends `Wubs\Trakt\Request\AbstractRequest`. This 
class is responsible for executing the request and passing the response to a response handler. Response handlers are 
explained [here][response-handlers].

### A Basic request object

The namespace of a request class equals the uri it has for the Trakt.tv API. For example, the request class for this 
url: `https://api-v2launch.trakt.tv/users/settings` is the class `Wubs\Trakt\Request\Users\Settings` Other requests, 
like the Follow Requests, or Approve Follower Request are namespaced like this: 
`Wubs\Trakt\Request\Users\Requests` and `Wubs\Trakt\Request\Users\ApproveFollowRequest`. 
 
 The code for an request object can be different for each request. For a basic get request like `users/requests` the 
 code is this:
 
 ```php
 <?php

 namespace Wubs\Trakt\Request\Users;
 
 use Wubs\Trakt\Request\AbstractRequest;
 use Wubs\Trakt\Request\RequestType;
 
 class Requests extends AbstractRequest
 {
     
     public function getRequestType()
     {
         return RequestType::GET;
     }
 
     public function getUri()
     {
         return "users/requests";
     }
 }
 
```

The request type is set through the `getRequestType()` method and the uri for the request is set through the `getUri
()` method. When an uri takes parameters, a request class needs to receive these parameters, and the uri must hold the
 placeholders for those parameters.
  
 An example for a request with parameters is the `user/history` request.
 
 ```PHP
 
 <?php
 namespace Wubs\Trakt\Request\Users;
 
 
 use Wubs\Trakt\Request\AbstractRequest;
 use Wubs\Trakt\Request\Parameters\Type;
 use Wubs\Trakt\Request\Parameters\Username;
 use Wubs\Trakt\Request\RequestType;
 
 class History extends AbstractRequest
 {
     /**
      * @var UserName
      */
     private $username;
     /**
      * @var Type
      */
     private $type;
 
     /**
      * @param Username $username
      * @param Type $type
      */
     public function __construct(Username $username, Type $type)
     {
         parent::__construct();
         $this->username = $username;
         $this->type = $type;
     }
 
     /**
      * @return Username
      */
     public function getUsername()
     {
         return $this->username;
     }
 
     /**
      * @return Type
      */
     public function getType()
     {
         return $this->type;
     }
 
     public function getRequestType()
     {
         return RequestType::GET;
     }
 
     public function getUri()
     {
         return "users/:username/history/:type";
     }
 }
 ```

In this class we add a constructor with strongly typed parameters (I'm not sure if they stay) to reflect the 
parameters that need to be send with this request. Also note the getters for these parameters, and finally the 
`getUri()` method. This method can return a string where the parameters are placeholders by adding a ':' in front of 
them. When the request gets executed, the uri is build by using the getter methods. So, when this uri is build, 
`getUsername()` and `getHistory()` ar both being used to get the value that's needed. 

### Making a request

Now that we know how a basic request class looks like, we can make a request with it. The method 
`Wubs\Trakt\Request\AbstractRequest::request()` is used to preform the request statically. Each request class 
inherits this method and makes it able to execute itself. 

The `request()` method can be used in different ways. The first argument is always the `client_id`, next you can 
either choose to add an access token, or add an array of parameters. The last argument can be an instance of an 
`ResponseHandler`, when not given it defaults to the `DefaultResponseHandler`. Note, the code below is example code.
  
```PHP
<?php
use Wubs\Trakt\Request\Example;

//with client id and parameters
$response = Example::request($clientId, $parameters, new MyResponseHandler());

//with client id, token and parameters
$response = Example::request($clientId, $accessToken, $parameters, new MyResponseHandler() );

//with client id and token
$response = Example::request($clientId, $accessToken, new MyResponseHandler());

//with client id, and response handler
$response = Example::request($clientId, new MyResponseHandler());
```

You get it, almost every option is possible. Inside the `request()` method, it's all figured out what's been given to
the method.
