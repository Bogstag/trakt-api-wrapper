Each request that can be made to the Trakt API is an object that extends `Wubs\Trakt\Request\AbstractRequest`. This 
class is responsible for executing the request and passing the response to a response handler. Response handlers are 
explained [here][response-handlers].

### A Basic request object

The namespace of a request class equals the uri it has for the Trakt.tv API. For example, the request class for this 
url: `https://api-v2launch.trakt.tv/users/settings` is the class `Wubs\Trakt\Request\Users\Settings` Other requests, 
like the Follow requests, or Approve Follower request are namespaced like this: 
`Wubs\Trakt\Request\Users\Requests` and `Wubs\Trakt\Request\Users\Followers\Approve`. 
 
 The code for an request object can be different for each request. For a basic get request like `users/requests` the 
 code is this:
 
 ```php
 <?php

 namespace Wubs\Trakt\Request\Users;
 
 use Wubs\Trakt\Request\AbstractRequest;
 use Wubs\Trakt\Request\RequestType;
 
 class Requests extends AbstractRequest
 {
     
     public function getRequestType()
     {
         return RequestType::GET;
     }
 
     public function getUri()
     {
         return "users/requests";
     }
 }
 
```

The request type is set through the `getRequestType()` method and the uri for the request is set through the `getUri
()` method. When an uri takes parameters, a request class needs to receive these parameters, and the uri must hold the
 placeholders for those parameters.
  
 An example for a request with parameters is the `user/history` request.
 
 ```PHP
 
 <?php
 namespace Wubs\Trakt\Request\Users;
 
 
 use Wubs\Trakt\Request\AbstractRequest;
 use Wubs\Trakt\Request\RequestType;
 
 class History extends AbstractRequest
 {
     /**
      * @var string
      */
     private $username;
     /**
      * @var string
      */
     private $type;
 
     /**
      * @param $username
      * @param $type
      */
     public function __construct($username, $type)
     {
         parent::__construct();
         $this->username = $username;
         $this->type = $type;
     }
 
     /**
      * @return string
      */
     public function getUsername()
     {
         return $this->username;
     }
 
     /**
      * @return Type
      */
     public function getType()
     {
         return $this->type;
     }
 
     public function getRequestType()
     {
         return RequestType::GET;
     }
 
     public function getUri()
     {
         return "users/:username/history/:type";
     }
 }
 ```

In this class we add a constructor with parameters to reflect the parameters that need to be send with this request.
 Also note the getters for these parameters, and finally the `getUri()` method. This method returns a string where 
 the parameter names have a ':' in front of them. When the request gets executed, the uri is build by using the getter methods. So, when this uri is build, 
`getUsername()` and `getHistory()` ar both being used to get the value that's needed. Resulting in a valid uri.

### Making a request

Now that we know how a basic request class looks like, we can make a request with it.  
This is done by initiating the class with the required parameters and call the `make()` method on it.
The arguments are your client id, an implementation of `ClientInterface` and a implementation of `ResponseHandler`. 
When you don't give it a `ResponseHandler` it defaults to the `DefaultResponseHandler`. See the code below for how 
this works with an existing request object.
  
```PHP
<?php

$get = new Wubs\Trakt\Request\Users\Followers\Get($token);

$response = $get->make($clientId, TraktHttpClient::make(), new MyResponseHandler());
```
