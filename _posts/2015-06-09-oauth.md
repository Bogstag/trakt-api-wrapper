The Trak.tv API uses OAuth. OAuth can be a bit hard to wrap your head around when it's the first time you use it. 

In general, OAuth is a way for third party apps to authenticate a user without asking their user name and password. 
You might know the flow of an facebook/twitter/google login on an other site? That's the OAuth flow. A user is 
directed to a page from the service we need information from, logs in, grants access and is redirected back to the 
site or app that needs the information. For the user, it's a simple flow. For us as developers its a bit complicated.

In general, an OAuth cycle is done in three steps. 

1.  Redirecting to the application you need access to (in our case, it's Trakt.tv). In this request, the user grants 
access to your application.
2. Trakt redirects back to a provided (and registered) url with a temporary `code` parameter in the url.
3. You can now request the OAuth access token with the code trakt just provided you.

This wrapper makes it easy to preform these three steps. The code below is demonstrated inside an [Lumen][lumen] 
application.

```PHP
<?php

// file: app/Http/routes.php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Input;
use Wubs\Trakt\Trakt;

//initiate trakt, give it your client id, secret and the redirect url
$trakt = new Trakt(
    env("TRAKT_CLIENT_ID"), env("TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET"), "http://trakt-api.app/trakt/oauth"
);

//register the index route, this method is executed when visiting http://trakt-api.app/
$app->get(
    '/',
    function () use ($trakt) {
        //this wil redirect you to the trakt website and, after authorization by the user, trakt will redirect back.
        $trakt->authorize();
    }
);

//register the oauth callback route. This route is given as the redirect url when creating the Trakt instance.
$app->get(
    'trakt/oauth',
    function () use ($trakt) {
        $code = Input::get('code');
        $accessToken = $trakt->getAccessToken($code);
        dump($accessToken);
    }
);
```

To be able to receive this callback when working locally (note, I'm using the `.app` domain extension), edit your 
`/etc/hosts/` file (I don't know the location of this file on Windows) and add an alias to your local development 
server, like so:

```TEXT
192.168.10.10	trakt-api.app
```

If you want to use [Lumen][lumen] or [Laravel][laravel] as your development framework, but you have no idea where to 
start, read my detailed guide [here][laravel-5-setup]. It only talks about Laravel, but Lumen is almost the same.
