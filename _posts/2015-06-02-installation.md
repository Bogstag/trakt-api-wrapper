# Installation

To be able to use this code inside your project, you first need a few things. If you are already familiar with 
composer you can skip this part.
 
## Download Composer

First you need composer. To install Composer run the following command in your terminal `curl -sS https://getcomposer
.org/installer | php` do when you don't have curl run: `php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php`
 
This will output some information about the download process.
